# HttpTestPlugin
## UE4 C++ developer test task
It is necessary to implement the possibility of obtaining data about the characters of the animated series "Rick and Morty" in Unreal Engine 4. Data about the characters must be obtained from the publicly available HTTP API, which is available at the link: [RickMorty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)
All operations for requesting data to the server and processing them must be performed in C++. It is allowed to use any third-party libraries.
## Requirements:
- Send a request to get information about a random character.
- Display information about the character with his information on the screen via the UI
- Make a request for character information as a separate blueprint node
- Design the project as a plug-in
- Make the node asynchronous
- Display both text information and an image with a character
## Result
(soon)
